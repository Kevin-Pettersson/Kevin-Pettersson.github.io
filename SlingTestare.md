If you ever have had a robotic lawnmower then you probably have experienced the frustration of the blinking light in the charging dock. I have made two different handy devices that checks for breakage in boundary and guide cables for robotic lawnmowers such as Husqvarna automower, Gardena silena and many more. The device pinpoints where the breakage is and signals it to the user via several leds, by knowing in which cable or between which cable the break is can dramatically decrease troubleshooting time and get you quickly back to letting the lawnmower do its job. 

I have created 2 diffrent verisons, one of which is a more advanced model that can check all cables at once (upto 5 cables, 2 of which are boundary and 3 guide) whereas the simpler verison only has 2 cables so the user will have to manually test all connections to pinpont the breakage. But the overall function is the same. 
These handy deviced can be bough from me directly via paypal or via Tindie and Ebay.

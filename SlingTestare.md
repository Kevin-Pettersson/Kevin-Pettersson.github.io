If you ever have had a roboti lawnmower then you probably have experienced the frustration of the blinking light in the charging dock. I have made two different handy devices that checks for breakage in boundary and guide cables for robotic lawnmowers such as Husqvarna automower, Gardena silena and many more. The device pinpoints where the breakage is and signals it to the user via several leds, by knowing in which cable or between which cable the break is can dramatically decrease troubleshooting time and get you quickly back to letting the lawnmower do its job.

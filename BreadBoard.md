If you have ever been in the market for something to power all your projects but prefer to use something to use something small and protable then look no further. My power supply can supply voltages from 3.3 V all the way up to 25 V therby eliminating the need for big, chunky expensive power supplies, my solution runs on USB-C and only requires 5 V 1 A input.

## Installation (jekyll-remote-theme method)

You can use this theme with the `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin. Just create an empty repo, copy over the `index.html` file and add this to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: niklasbuschmann/contrast@v2.11

plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
```

Note: to enable icons you also need to copy over the `_data` folder.

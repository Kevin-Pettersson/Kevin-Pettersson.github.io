If you own a horse or a animal which need to be feed mutiple times a day at odd times then you surely are tired of having to wake up early and stay up late at night to feed your precious pets. With my developed product you can schedule 2 meals a day to be released to the animal at 2 times of your choosing, it was orignally created for use with horses but its use cases are much wider. The product works like this, when you get the product the time and date is already set, the first thing you have to do is set the times via the buttons and display on the PCB for when the food is suppposed to be relased. After that you hook up your system of feeding the product works with 12 and 24 V systems so its very universal in its operation. One use case is to have boxes of hay latched with a reversed electro magnet so you power the product via 12 or 24 V and connect the wires from the magnets into the screw terminal on the PDB from now on you only have to refill the boxes and can take a proper sleep in from not having to stay up late and waking up early to do the feeding.
